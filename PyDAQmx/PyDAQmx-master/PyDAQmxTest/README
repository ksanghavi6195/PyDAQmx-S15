The PyDAQmxTest forder contains the test suite of PyDAQmx

In order to run the full suite, you need to install a virtual device using Measurement and Automation Explorer (NI-MAX) software. A general device, such as the PCI-6259, will be OK. This device should be renamed "TestDevice".  

The easiest way to run the test os with the setup.py file ::

    python setup.py test
